            <h6 class="my-3">What is normal body skin type?</h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Normal skin is balance and used to descibe skin that is neither too oily nor too dry. It maintains an optimal level of hydration, which helps keep the skin soft and it is less prone to breakouts, flakiness, acne and blemishes. The sebaceous glands in normal skin produce an adequate amount of sebum (natural oils). This helps maintain the skin's moisture levels without causing excessive oiliness or dryness.</p>

           <h6 class="my-3">What is Oily Skin Type?</h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Oily skin is a common skin type characterized by an excessive production of sebum, the natural oil produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. Sebum is essential for maintaining skin hydration and protecting it from external factors. However, when the sebaceous glands produce too much sebum, it can lead to oily skin. <br> <br> Oily skin often appears shiny or greasy, especially in the "T-zone" area (forehead, nose, and chin). This is because sebaceous glands are more concentrated in these regions. It is more prone to developing acne unlike normal skin which is less prone to acne. The excess sebum can clog pores, providing an ideal environment for acne-causing bacteria to thrive. This can lead to the formation of pimples, inflammatory acne, and occasional breakouts.  Oily skin can make it challenging to keep makeup in place. The excess oil can cause makeup to slide off or become patchy throughout the day. <br><br> However oily skin could be managed following few steps which would be discussed later</p>

           <h6 class="my-3">What is Dry Skin Type?</h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Dry skin is a skin type characterized by a lack of moisture and oil in the skin. It can occur due to various factors, including genetics, environmental conditions, 
            aging, and certain medical conditions. Dry skin occurs when the sebaceous glands in the skin 
            produce insufficient oil (sebum) to lubricate and moisturize the skin. This leads to a compromised 
            skin barrier, which is responsible for retaining moisture. <br> <br> Dry skin often feels tight and may appear rough or 
            flaky. It may be more prone to sensitivity and can feel uncomfortable or itchy, especially in areas prone to dryness, such as the legs, arms, and face. It can lack the natural glow and radiance that well-moisturized skin possesses. The lack of oil can make the skin look dull and may accentuate fine lines and wrinkles. <br> <br>  Dry skin is more susceptible to irritation and can react more easily to environmental factors like harsh weather, hot water, and certain skincare products. It may also be prone to conditions like eczema or dermatitis. Due to the compromised skin barrier, dry skin is more susceptible to premature aging signs like wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging. The lack of moisture and oil can make the skin less supple and elastic.</p>

                 <h6 class="my-3">What is Combination Skin Type?</h6>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">Combination skin is a skin type characterized by having both oily and dry areas
                   on the face. Typically, the T-zone area 
                  (forehead, nose, and chin) tends to be oily, while the cheeks and other areas may
                   be dry or normal. Combination skin can 
                  be challenging to manage as it requires addressing the needs of both oily and dry areas. Here's a breakdown of combination
                  skin and its characteristics:</p>
